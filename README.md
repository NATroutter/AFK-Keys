## Introduction
Introducing a revolutionary mod that is better than tape or glue designed to replicate the action of holding down buttons effortlessly during AFK sessions. This exceptional mod proves invaluable when engaging in farming activities that necessitate prolonged button pressing or when undertaking monotonous tasks such as extensive walking or boating, this mod not only keeps your buttons pressed but also relinquishes control of your cursor, allowing you to multitask efficiently on your computer without interruption.

## How To Use
Operating this mod is a breeze. Simply press and hold any button or key of your choice, and with a quick tap of the `Activate` key, your selected buttons will remain pressed down automatically.

## Credits
This mod is inspired by [AFKtape](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/afktape) by [Kokeria](https://www.curseforge.com/members/kokeria/projects).  
This mod is completely rewritten from scratch and is not a fork of AFKtape. even though the idea and UI is similar, the implementation is different.
